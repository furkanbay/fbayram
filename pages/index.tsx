            I&apos;m a designer and developer from Turkey. I love being in the
            outdoors; hiking and travelling are some of the things I do to clear
            my mind and relax.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-500 mt-4">
            Being able to both design and develop is a lot of fun. When you have
            an idea, there&apos;s nothing holding you back from building it.
